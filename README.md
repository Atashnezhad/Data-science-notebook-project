# Project success analysis
 Several ML algorithms are applied to determine whether a project will be successful, or not.


 
### Project statement
In this toturial I applied several ML algorithms to data set to determine if a project would be successful or not. 
In this work, You will learn how to handle:

```
Project
  
|__ 1. Missed values
|__ 2. Adding a new column to data  
|__ 3. Delete some useless columns
|__ 4. Visualization 
|__ 5. Parameters Featuring and Transforming (Dealing with those parameters that are an object not digit)
|__ 6. Splitting data (train, validate and test)
|__ 7. Fitting ML models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gaussian, Linear SVC)
|__ 8. Accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity or Recall, F1 score concepts
|__ 9. Evaluating Model Performances

```
