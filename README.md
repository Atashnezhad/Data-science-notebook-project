# Project success analysis
 Several ML algorithms are applied to determine whether a project will be successful, or not.


 
### Project statement
In this toturial I applied several ML algorithms to data set to determine if a project would be successful or not. 
In this work, You will learn how to handle:

1. Missed values
2. Adding a new column to data
3. Delete some useless columns
4. Visualization
5. Parameters Featuring and Transforming (Dealing with those parameters that are an object not digit)
6. Splitting data (train, validate and test)
7. Fitting ML models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gaussian, Linear SVC)
8. Accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity or Recall, F1 score concepts
9. Evaluating Model Performances
